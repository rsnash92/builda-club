> **BUIDL Your Community's Future**

Transform online communities into builder DAOs where members become co-owners, not subscribers. Built with battle-tested Web3 infrastructure (Privy, Vercel, Supabase, thirdweb), builda.club delivers a seamless experience for both crypto natives and mainstream users.

## 🚀 The Vision

**builda.club** empowers any Discord or Telegram group to BUIDL a collectively-owned entity with shared resources, governance rights, and aligned incentives. Unlike traditional platforms where value flows to platform owners, or failed Web3 social tokens that become speculation vehicles, we focus on building value, not trading speculation.

**The genius**: "builda" = "build a club" for normies, "build a DAO" for the informed, and taps directly into crypto's beloved BUIDL culture.

## 💎 Token Economics

### Community Club Tokens (Non-Tradeable)
- **Purpose**: Prevent speculation, maintain focus on building
- **Distribution**: 70% builders, 15% founders, 10% early, 5% treasury
- **Mechanics**: Linear bonding curve with 10% exit slippage

### $BUIDL Platform Token
- **Supply**: 1 billion fixed supply
- **Utility**: Club creation, staking, governance, rewards
- **Value**: Deflationary from burning, staking reduces supply
